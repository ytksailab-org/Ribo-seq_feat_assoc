# VeloPro

#Here we developed a pipeline: VeloPro to decipher the association pattern between translation velocity and protein structure features in diverse organisms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematode, plants, insect and mammals.

Introduction

Translation velocity plays an important role iin modulating co-translational protein folding and protein functional integrity.Here we provide an easy-to-use and modifiable pipeline that anable to conduct the association analysis between translation velocity and many protein structure features in diverse organisms. This pipeline contains translation velocity quantification procedure and protein structure deterimination procedure in detail with step-by-step explanations.
